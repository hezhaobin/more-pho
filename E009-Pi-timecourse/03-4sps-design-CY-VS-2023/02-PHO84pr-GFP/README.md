this experiment is modeled after Gurvich et al 2017 Fig. 1, where the authors showed that _PHO84_ expression assayed by a transcriptional reporter strongly predicts the change in growth rates. Specifically, at multiple external [Pi], the point where the strain's growth started to decline coincided with the _PHO84pr_-GFP reporter exceeding a cutoff level, suggesting that _PHO84_ expression level serves as a proxy for the internal cellular state. It effectively serves as a "pseudo time" that unites the growth curves from different experiments.
