establish an alternative method to CFU assay for quantitatively estimating survival rate after stress treatment. The goal is to make the assay reproducible and more scalable than the CFU assay. The main approach is to use viability dye to stain the cells and use flow cytometry to obtain single cell measures of fluorescent intensity, in order to estimate the survival rate. It is important to establish a correspondance between the new method yielded results with the gold standard of CFU measures. In preliminary studies, it seems some of the viability dyes, such as FUN1, takes time to reach the level of staining in damaged cells, such that an incubation period is required after the stress treatment. During this period, it is important to prevent the cells from dividing. A cell cycle blocker, like hydroxyurea (HU), is tested as a way to achieve that.
