# Goal
This sub-project aims to construct a dual-fluorescence reporter system to replace the Pho5 secreted phosphatase assay, in order to account for chimeric Pho4 expression level and to make the assay more quantitative.

# Material
1. Xu has generated a series of plasmids (EB2175-2206) that are based on pRS306 (integrating into the _URA3_ locus)
1. Yeast host: yH159 and yH161, and their derivatives with chimeric Pho4 integrated into the native Pho4 locus
