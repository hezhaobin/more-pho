### Goal

Analyze BLI data to check the consistency between batches of experiments and compare the binding affinities between ScPho4 vs CgPho4 DBDs against the consensus motif and the nine 1-bp-off variants.

## 2021-03-29 update
What's new in this analysis is that Chris Ptak joined the P&CF and helped us prepare two batches of ScPho4 DBD and CgPho4 DBD. The quality of the protein is high and stayed high over the course of over a month at 4C. I was thus able to screen the 10 oligo library for both proteins. Another new piece is the method used for inferring Kd. In all past analyses, I use the Octet data analysis softwrae to extract the Req by averaging the signal over 5 sec close to the end of the association phase. I then fit a one-site specific binding equation to the Req values over the series of protein titration (concentration series) in Prism. In this analysis, I used the built-in curve fitting functions in the Data Analysis software, which fits the kinetic curves (sensorgram for association and dissociation) to extract both the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ as well as the kinetic parameters $k_{on}$ and $k_{off}$.

> to discuss: reason to use (or not to use) kinetic curve fitting vs the equilibrium state fitting

### Data

| Batch | Exp. Date | Analyte |  Concentration | Notes |
|:------|:----------|:--------|:---------------|:------|
| rH021a| 01/2020 | CgPho4 | 3.8 mg/mL | peak 1 from Heparin column |
| rH021b| 01/2020 | CgPho4 | 2.0 mg/mL | peak 2 from Heparin column |
| rH022 | 01/2020 | mixture| 1.7 mg/mL | ScPho4 DBD contaminated with CgPho4 DBD |
| rH023 | 02/2020 | ScPho4 | 1.8 mg/mL | peak 1 from Heparin column |

### Load data
```{r}
dat <- read_tsv("../data/BLI/2021-Jan-Feb-Kd-estimates.tsv") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Model)) %>% 
  mutate(Half_site = factor(str_sub(Ligand,7,9), 
                            levels = c("CAC","AAC","TAC","GAC","CTC","CCC","CGC","CAA","CAT","CAG")))
```

### Compare ScPho4 and CgPho4 DBD binding affinities
```{r compare_Kd, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# plot Kd Â± 95%CI for each experiment, fill-color by protein source
dat %>%
  # use the latest batch of protein results only, and only use the 1:1 model fitting
  filter(Include, str_sub(Batch, 1, 5) %in% c("rH021","rH023"), Model == "1:1") %>%
  mutate(Kd = Kd_c * 1e9, Kd_err = Kd_c_err * 1e9) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Half_site, y = Kd, fill = Protein)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Kd - Kd_err, ymax = Kd + Kd_err), position = position_dodge2()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue2","green3")) +
