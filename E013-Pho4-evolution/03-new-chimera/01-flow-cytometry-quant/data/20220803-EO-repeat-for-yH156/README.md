this is a repeat of the 07/26 and 06/02 run. the former because the GFP signals in yH156 is higher than usual, while the other GFP+ strains do not seem to be, resulting in lower background subtracted GFP, the latter because the FSC values on that run were relatively small, resulting in higher cell-size normalized signals. However, in this run yH156 still showed higher GFP channel readings.
