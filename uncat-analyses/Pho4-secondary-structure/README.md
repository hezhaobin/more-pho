# Goal
The goal of this analysis is to predict the secondary structures for Pho4 orthologs. In particular, we wish to understand the alpha helices content in the N-terminal domain in Pho4 orthologs and how that correlate with the activation domain activities.

# Approach
- jpred4.0 as implemented in Jalview v2.11.0
- [PSIPRED](http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/)
