# Goal

Follow Metzger _et al._ 2015 (PMID: 25778704) to learn how to analyze flow cytometry data in R

# Data

From 2021-04-02 experiment conducted by Jia and Lindsey to test the chimeric Pho4 with _PHO5p_-RFP strains

# Analysis
## Import data
```{r}
example.file = "data/FCS-files/Chimeric Pho4 test_Experiment_Lindsey_179w-1.fcs"
example <- read.FCS(example.file, transformation = FALSE, emptyValue = FALSE) # the original values are already linearized. 
```
