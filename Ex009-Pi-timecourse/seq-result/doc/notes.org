* <2018-05-02 Wed> CgPho4 target gene annotation, reanalyze 2017 results
The goal of this analysis is to make a table that summarizes the metadata available for all putative Cgla4 targets
** Reading notes
*** CAGL0J08294g(BOR1)
- according to Nozawa et al 2006, "In plants, borate cross-links the *cell wall* pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II"
* <2018-04-27 Fri> time course analysis
What questions can I ask using this dataset?
** Focus on the earliest time point
*** how many DE genes are there at the earliest time point?
*** which ones are exclusively dependent on Pho4?
*** how much overlap is there between DE genes at the first time point and the DE genes identified in the /pho80-/ background?
** TODO create gene ID/name lists based on 2017 eLife paper, and assess the level of support from the time course data
