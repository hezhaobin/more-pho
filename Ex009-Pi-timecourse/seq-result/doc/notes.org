* <2018-04-27 Fri> time course analysis
What questions can I ask using this dataset?
** Focus on the earliest time point
*** how many DE genes are there at the earliest time point?
*** which ones are exclusively dependent on Pho4?
*** how much overlap is there between DE genes at the first time point and the DE genes identified in the /pho80-/ background?
** TODO create gene ID/name lists based on 2017 eLife paper, and assess the level of support from the time course data
**
