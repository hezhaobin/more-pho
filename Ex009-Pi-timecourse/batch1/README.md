## Summary

This is batch 1 of the RNA-seq time-course experiment. In this batch, the goal is to work through the RNA extraction and library prep protocol.

## Sample

S29-36, late time points in the time-course, high OD thus have back up vials

## Results

- RNA extraction worked fine.
- Library prep using Ethanomics TruSeq stranded mRNA 1/3 protocol worked fine.
	- did 12 cycles of pcr and got between 30 and 130 ng/uL in 9 uL volume.
	- Bioanalyzer shows that the fragment size has a peak at around 270 bp.

## Conclusion

- Pilot experiment worked well. Proceed on to finish the remaining samples.
