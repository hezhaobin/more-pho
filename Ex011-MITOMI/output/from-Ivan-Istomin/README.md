> Dear Bin,
> 
> Hope you were doing great! After chatting with Sebastian, I’ve shared the two folders with C.glabrata Pho4p with you on the Dropbox. There you’ll find two sets of images for each folder, those correspond to two chips that I’ve run on the same dates with the Pho4p expressed in T7 wheat germ lysate from Promega. I label the protein cotranslationally with tRNA-lysine-BODIPY that gets incorporated into the protein along with the regular lysine. The Pho4p version that I’m using is taken from your plasmid and C-His tagged. I bind these molecules to the surface of MITOMI button using Quiagen biotinylated anti-His antibodies. After that I’m using the library of targets with one-off variants of NNNGTG E-box with the consensus of CACGTG giving us 10 variants, as well as all permutations of NNCACGTG flanking of targets, giving us 16 variants (one already included in the previous set in default flanking actually). I spot the DNA on MITOMI from 2uM to 4.86nM in 6 dilutions with titration step of factor 0.3. Then I run MITOMI experiment, analyse them with GenePix (I can guide you more in detail through the image analysis) and get the fits that you can as well see in the folders that I’ve shared with you under “images”. I’m fitting 1-site binding model for Hill function, the red line is the fit. Then I calculate the Kd in the fit [DNA * Pho4] = saturation level * [DNA in solution] / ( [DNA in solution] + Kd), after that I’m converting the Kds in the units of fluorescent relative units to the molar concentrations using the calibration curve (attached) that gives me 17.25 RFU / nM. I have the Kds calculations in MITOMI_Cg_affinities.xlsx file attached.

> I’d suggest we chat on Skype these days so that I can explain in more detail how I’m organising my data. For instance, the three images files that you’ll find for each experiment are : FITC at 400ms exposure protein attached to the surface (GenePix wavelength 1), Cy5 100ms exposure DNA target in solution before wash (GenePix wavelength 2), and Cy5 100ms exposure DNA target attached to Pho4p after wash (GenePix wavelength 3).
