We discovered that a relatively short period (45 min) of phosphate starvation increases the resistance of _C. glabrata_ cells to severe (100 mM) hydrogen peroxide by three fold. This acquired resistance effect is stronger with increasing length of phosphate starvation. In the related baker's yeast _S. cerevisiae_, 45 min of phosphate starvation didn't trigger a protective effect for a lethal dose (10 mM) of hydrogen perxoide. Longer (>90 min) treatment of phosphate starvation did induce mild protection for a lethal dose of H2O2. The cross-stress protection effect is much less than in _C. glabrata_.
