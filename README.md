This repository is a continuation of the "PHO" repository I used during my postdoc. In that repo, I documented results that led to the publication of the eLife paper. Here, I'd like to flip to a new page, partly because the previous repo is alrady large, but also because I want to test a new folder structure. In this repo, the first-level directories are organized by individual _self-contained_ experiments, rather than broad categories such as ChIP or Transcription. Each of these 1st-level directories could then contain sub-directories that are, again, smaller experiments, such as "pilot" or "library-prep" in case of an RNA-seq experiment. It is in the latter directories that I will establish the actual analysis/data structure. The standard structure will contain "analysis / code / data / output" sub-directories, and each will have its own "README.md"
